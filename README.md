# University specified repo for homeworks and so.
# The main point is to create a c++ code that stores and views students details.
# Nature of the exercise is to follow a step by step instructions, starting by the first file with the minimum code, with minimum inputs and outputs.
# Logic is to modify step 1's code so it can include step 2, and modify step 2's code so it can include step 3, and so on.
# Due to misspelled words, it was challenging to understand some steps, but the main point of the program is reserved.
